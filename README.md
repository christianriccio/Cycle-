# Cycle-
Cycle is a project that we built for the call to challenge of Acea into the big hack digital edition 2021 hosted by codemotion and promoved by Regione Campania and Maker Faire Rome, in partnership with università deli studi di napoli federico II and Apple Developer Academy.

Team Composed by:
- Daniele Romano: Java & Web Develope
- Christian Riccio: Data Scientist 
- Sarah Riccio: UX/UI Designer
- Elio Fortunato:New Media Artist
- Alessandro Di Benedetto: Penetration Tester 

The call to the challenge:

Green Leap

Challenge promossa da Acea

ACEA è una delle principali multiutility italiane, è il primo operatore nazionale nell’area idrica e tra i principali player italiani nei settori Energia (produzione, distribuzione e vendita) e Ambiente (trattamento e valorizzazione rifiuti).
È quindi obiettivo della challenge quello di progettare, facendo riferimento ai principali business aziendali e a partire dagli SDGs prioritari per Acea, soluzioni digitali che permettano di sensibilizzare e responsabilizzare i cittadini e/o le imprese, incentivando comportamenti virtuosi sui temi della sostenibilità ambientale.
Si faccia particolare riferimento al concetto di Economia circolare, ovvero la trasformazione dei rifiuti in risorse per minimizzare l’impatto degli stessi sull’ambiente, oppure al tema della sensibilizzazione sull’Utilizzo della risorsa idrica, immaginando soluzioni che abbiano l’obiettivo di ridurre gli sprechi della risorsa, valorizzarne la qualità percepita anche in ambiente domestico e creare consapevolezza sul servizio idrico integrato.
Più in generale si sviluppi il tema del Risparmio energetico e del Consumo responsabile dell’energia, per incentivare la produzione di energia green e ridurre i consumi e gli sprechi. Si pensi ad esempio a soluzioni che permettano di avere immediata consapevolezza dei consumi energetici senza la necessità di un misuratore specifico.

What we have done is illustred in the following video pitch firstly:

What we want oto do with Cycle? 

First of all, we decided to involve individuals, companies and traders in a responsible sorting of waste and a conscious use of water resources. We want to do this by giving visibility to the partners who decide to participate in the initiative by engaging in the themes of the circular economy and telling their business stories, with the aim of pushing them to grow and also to influence other competitors on the operation regarding the issue of sustainability. environmental. Thus uniting everyone under the banner of Cycle!

Then we thought that we could provide citizens with a tool, a container where they can create and actively participate in campaigns to raise awareness and improve environmental problems throughout the territory.

There will be the opportunity to create and participate in crowfunding campaigns, environmental protection events and Webinair from this section.

By actively participating in this type of event you will have the opportunity to receive points, the cycle points.

Starting from this concept of gamification, we have decided to give in addition to a symbolic value also a value that can feed the circular economy, creating a shop section where users can take advantage of discounts, using cycle points, to buy from our partners who produce eco-sustainable and / or recycled product

We also thought of RESAICOL: a tool that could help us educate the citizen. Now with surrender you have no more excuses for not doing separate collection. A common problem is understanding how to divide our waste so that the differentiation is as effective as possible. Our method is the classic learning by doing, an AI capable of recognizing what is framed through the camera and at the same time giving information about the nature of the objects, in which case the waste / s used also information on the correct disposal of the same and hence the vessel for which they are intended. In conclusion, our technology is committed to ensuring that everyone can have virtuous behavior towards the environment through proper separate collection.

Obviously this is only the first version of RESAICOL, in our opinion this should be a starting point for a future intelligent bin capable of automatically sorting the waste that is supplied to it.


In the following repository you will be able to find a web prototype that works on a local server menaged under flask, in enable us to integrate our python code into html and start a live stream from the browser and the webcam of the pc. The live stream is the passed into the YOLO deep learning algorithms that perform a live object detection.

Whit the material you will find a readme file and also a .pdf file with instructions describing how to run the project. There is also shown a prototuype of the mobile application and other lots of stuff hahaa :) enjoy !!!
